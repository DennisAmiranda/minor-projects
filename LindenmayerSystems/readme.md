# LindenmayerSystems - L-Systems
This mini-project is about the implementation of different L-Systems which can generate different fractal structures such as the sierpinski triangle.
I made it with Python and the turtle library. The main resources I used for learning were: 
- The Wikipedia page of L-systems: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system
- Turtle library: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html
